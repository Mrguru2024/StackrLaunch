This error is being caused by **Vite trying to establish a WebSocket connection**, but the URL it's using is **invalid** because the **port is `undefined`**.

---

### 🔍 Breakdown of the Error:
- **Error**: `Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/?token=...' is invalid.`
- **Reason**: The `port` value is not set properly, so the WebSocket URL ends up being invalid: `wss://localhost:undefined`.

---

### 🎯 Why This Happens:
This usually occurs when:
1. **Vite is running in a non-standard environment** (like Replit or a remote container).
2. The **WebSocket server port isn’t properly defined**, either in:
   - The Vite client script (`@vite/client`)
   - The environment variables (`VITE_PORT`, `VITE_HOST`, etc.)
3. You're running in **HTTPS mode (`wss`)** but missing required secure setup.

---

### ✅ How to Fix It:

#### Option 1: Specify the Port Manually
Make sure you **set the port** explicitly in your Vite config:

```js
// vite.config.js
export default {
  server: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 5173, // or any port you're using
    strictPort: true,
  }
}
```

> Also confirm in `.env` file:
```env
VITE_PORT=5173
```

---

#### Option 2: Disable Hot Module Reload (Temporary Workaround)
If you're on **Replit or a cloud IDE**, you can **disable HMR** to avoid the WebSocket error:

```js
export default {
  server: {
    hmr: false
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ Use this only for temporary debugging or deployment previews. HMR is great for local development.

---

#### Option 3: Fix Replit Configuration
If you're on **Replit**, the port may be set dynamically. Use this pattern to read it:

```js
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

Then apply it in Vite:

```js
server: {
  port: port,
  host: '0.0.0.0'
}
```

Also ensure you're serving over `http` and not `https` unless explicitly needed.

---

### 🧪 Final Check
- Go to your dev tools > Network > WS tab and check the WebSocket connection URL.
- Ensure your **vite client scripts** aren’t hardcoding the WebSocket path.
- Re-run Vite after config changes.

If you’re still stuck, share your `vite.config.js` and `.env` files and I’ll review them with you.
