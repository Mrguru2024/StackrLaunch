      question: 'Can Stackr help me track deductible expenses for my side hustle?',
      answer:
        'Yes! Stackr automatically categorizes and tracks business expenses that may be tax-deductible for your side hustle. The platform distinguishes between personal and business transactions, providing real-time tracking of potential deductions and generating expense reports that make tax filing easier and more accurate.',

    },
    {
      question: 'Is Stackr secure? How do you protect my financial data?',

        'Stackr employs bank-level encryption (256-bit AES) and secure, read-only connections to your financial accounts. We never store your banking credentials, use multi-factor authentication, and conduct regular security audits. Stackr is built on the same security infrastructure used by major financial institutions, ensuring your sensitive data remains protected.',
